# COMP3161-Project

**Note: For smooth integration of data, create the tables first, then run fake_data.py to generate the insert queries (I had to zip it because the file is very large - just unzip once you clone it). Afterwards, run insert_sql_queries.py to insert the statements. Once you've done that you're good to go!**

**P.S. - You can run the report queries if you feel curious (more than likely Vedang)**
